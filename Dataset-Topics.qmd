Things you plan to investigate using this dataset:

- What is the average age gap between love interests in movies for specific actors?
- Does the increase of an actor's appearance in movies have an affect on age gap of their love interest?
- Does the release year of the movie change the age gap between the main love interests?

Stat 251 topics you plan to cover during the analysis:

1. Data cleaning
2. Visualizing your data efficiently 
3. Working with strings
4. Reshaping data
